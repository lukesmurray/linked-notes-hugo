# inspirations

List of people, organizations, and sites which I find appealing or view as inspirational.

## Learning in Public

****

### [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/)

Gwern is a great source of inspiration for this site.
I like Gwern's philosophy about trying to develop software for the long now and using stable tools.
Gwern does an impressive job of archiving information that is linked from his site.
He wrote some stats as of 2020 which indicated he has approximately 40mb of text on his site but 18.3GB of content.
The amount of rich linking from his site is amazing.
Also Gwern is a voracious reader.
Every time I traverse his site I feel like I've found a gold mine of links and content.

### [beepb00p](https://beepb00p.xyz/)

beepb00p does very interesting work in the domain of personal knowledge management and the quantified self.

### [Devon Zuegel](https://devonzuegel.com/)

Found Devon through Patrick Collinson's twitter purge.
She was one of the first 15 people he followed.

### [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/)

Found Nadia through Patrick Collinson's twitter purge.
She was one of the first 15 people he followed.

### [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)

Andy's notes were the primary inspiration for this writing project.
I love his essay's with Michael Nielsen.

### [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/)

Michael Nielsen's essay *Augmenting Longterm Memory* [@nielsenAugmentingLongtermMemory2018] is what got me into spaced repetition software.

## Explorables and Explanations

### [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/)

Nicky's explorables are beautiful.
I first came across Nicky's [parables of polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/).
More recently I saw [To Build a Better Ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/).
The writing is fantastic and the art and interactive visualizations help make complex topics much easier to approach.

### [Josh Comeau](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/)

Josh Comeau is an incredibly talented react developer and this explorably of waveforms is beautiful.

## Blog Design

### [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/)

The side notes on Ink and Switch are generated completely using CSS.
Kenneth Friedman describes a similar looking technique which uses [aside and padding](https://kennethfriedman.org/thoughts/2019/marginal-notes/).
The website is beautifully responsive. Figure captions smoothly transition from sidenotes to captions.

### [Sam Bleckley](https://sambleckley.com/)

The unordered list styling on this site is very nice.
But the quality I like most about this site is the asymmetrical design.
The off center aspects and bold colors reminds me of print.

### [Josh Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com/)

Josh Comeau's blog is absolutely lovely.
The sound effects, quirky animations and attention to detail make him stand out on the web.

## Documentation Design

### [Atomiks Tippy.JS](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/all-props/)

The colors on this site are beautiful, varied, and consistent.
But the highlight for me is the super simple left margin in the text.[^leftMarginWord]
I love how the block elements fill the space equally but the text is indented within each block.

[^leftMarginWord]:
  Is there a word for the line created by the left side of typography.
  I swear I saw the line named once in an article about aligning quotation marks when rendering block quotes.

### [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/)

The LuaJIT website may be suprising but I really like how the shades of blue overlap and become darker to create the logo.
This is a simple physical feeling design which I would like to adopt in one of my own projects.

## Algorithmic Art

### [Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock)

Mike Bostock is a polymath and any list of algorithmic art will eventually be incomplete without his name.
A lot of his work is recreating examples but he does so with absolutely clear code which is easy to build off of.

Examples
: [Circle Wave](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/circle-wave)
: [Bridson's Algorithm](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/bridsons-algorithm)
: [Clifford Attractor III](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/clifford-attractor-iii)

![Mike Bostock's [Clifford Attractor III](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/clifford-attractor-iii) is absolutely stunning](/assets/mike-bostock-cliffor-attractor.png)

### [Inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/)

Inconvergent is the humorous and self deprecating artist pseudonym for Anders Hoff.
The name stems from when Anders diverged from his studies for finals in university to make algorithmic art.
Ander's work is beautiful and his writing is a joy to read.
I first stumbled across Ander's work while reading the depth of field effect he implemented for [drawing webs](https://inconvergent.net/2019/a-tangle-of-webs-3d/).
I then read his entire essay series about [generative algorithms](https://inconvergent.net/generative/) which I highly recommend.

Some work I really love from his oeuvre is

- [line trace](https://inconvergent.net/generative/linetrace/)
an algorithmic recreation of [John Franzen's line work](http://www.johnfranzen.com/each-line-one-breath.html).

### [Jared Tarbell](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/)

Cofounder of Etsy.
Also happens to build beautiful algorithmic art in processing.
A lot of the art is from 2005 which is impressive because the techniques have been reused many times since.
One technique Tarbell uses which I find beautiful is sand painting.
Imagine painting a picture one grain of sand at a time.
A dark line can be created by dropping a thick trail of sand.
A finer line can be created by dropping a more dispersed or thinner trail of sand.
Tarbell draws pixels one grain of sand at a time and moves a virtual sand painter around the canvas according to an algorithm.
The lines which the algorithm retraces are darker than lines traced fewer times.
Fine lines have a whispy gaseous appearance.

A great example of the sand painting effect is Jared Tarbell's piece *Happy Place*

![Jarded Tarbell Happy Place](/assets/happyPlace.jpg)

The whispy trails on the edge of *Happy Place* are beautiful.

## Software Developers [^softwareDeveloper]

[^softwareDeveloper]: The term software developer is used loosely.
  I admire these people for the full breadth of their work, not just their software.
  Raph Levien for example is not only a prolific programmer but also the creator of the font [inconsolata](https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html).

### [Raph Levien](https://raphlinus.github.io/)

Raph Levien is a prolific programmer,
the founder of the xi editor project,
and an excelllent font designer.
I particularly appreciate Raph's transparency about both the success and failure in software development.
His [xi retrospective](https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html) is an excellent read for anyone struggling to keep up with a long software project.

### [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/)

Marijn is clearly an incredibly talented software engineer.
Prose Mirror and Code Mirror are very well engineered.
One day I would love to sit down and read through all the software engineering posts on Marijn's blog, they date back to 2007.

### [Heydon Pickering](https://heydonworks.com/)

Creater of [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/) and author of [Inclusive Components](http://book.inclusive-components.design/).
I find Heydon's advice to be both incredibly interesting and practically useful.
Every-Layout teaches basic design patterns for designing layouts in CSS and completely changed the way I do web development.
Many of the design patterns are being used in this blog.
