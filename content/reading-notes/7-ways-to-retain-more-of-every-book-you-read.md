# 7 ways to Retain More of Every Book You Read

I like James Clear's rule to summarize books in 3 sentences.
Everything else in his summaries is a list of bullet points which is similar to what I'm doing currently.

1. [[[Quit more books]]](). only read excellent books.
2. choose books which are immediately applicable to your life.
3. keep searchable notes
4. keep track of cross references between notes, books, and ideas
5. write a short summary as soon as you're done
6. support your beliefs with knowledge, read more than one book if you're interested in a topic
7. allow yourself to reread but only the best books
