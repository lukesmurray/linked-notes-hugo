# a short guide to managing your time and fitting more into every day

This brief guide from Rescue Time is an excellent synopsis of techniques and strategies for saving time.
Overall I think the guide has some great tips.
The focus is on organizing your day, finding meaning in your work, and doing deep work without distractions.
Because the guide is so short I recommend reading it.
However, I found the guide lacked advice for procrastination which is definitely one of the issues I struggle with.
To solve the procrastination issue I plan to read Overcoming Procrastination: The ultimate guide to finishing what you start. [@OvercomingProcrastinationUltimate2019]

Some meaningful changes I want to take away from this guide.

## Summary

- Avoid Burnout
  - People burnout because they feel disconnected from their work.
  - Find connection in your work by adding more.
    It is counterintuitive since people who are burning out feel like they are doing too much.
    But adding tasks you enjoy can be helpful
  - Some people find that they can create checkpoints of enjoyment to stave off burnout.
    For example if you love design work, make sure you do 30 minutes of design work once a day.
    You can still focus on work you don't necessarily enjoy doing.
    But the time you spend doing something you enjoy helps avoid feelings of anxiety, depression, and a need for breaks.
- Take care of yourself
  - Hydrate, eat well, exercise daily, and sleep 8 hours a night.
  Just doing these four things is proven over and over again to enhance people's mood, cognitive ability, life span, and health.
- Structure your work time
  - Limit your work hours to 49 per week.
    More than 49 hours of work per week has diminishing returns and limits time spent with family, friends, and doing stuff you enjoy.
  - Set time for work and time for not working.
  At first people may get mad if you stop responding to emails at 5pm but then they will get used to it and only send you emails when you are working.
  - Studies have shown that people who have more flexible work hours are more likely to have work conflict with family time.
- Finding Meaning
  - People who find meaning have better performance, job satisfaction, commitment, and salary.
  - > Happiness and meaning aren’t the same
    > There’s a clear difference between feeling happiness and feeling meaningfulness in your life. And the difference is important, because they each produce different results long-term.
    > So what is the difference? A happy life is about seeking pleasure and enjoyment, avoiding discomfort, and doing what’s best for you as often as possible, whereas a meaningful life is about connecting with and helping others, and contributing to something beyond yourself—such as family, nature, or your work.
    > [@ShortGuideManaging]
  - People often don't see meaning in their work until after the fact.
  - You can find meaning by picking tasks you enjoy, changing your relationships, and by changing the way you think about your job.
- Choose something to be bad at
  - There is no free lunch. You cannot be good at everything so choose what you will be bad at and stick to it.
  - Likewise choose what you will be good at and stick to it.
  - If you are going to be bad at email then be bad at email but if you are going to be good at email then respond promptly to every email.
- Block deep work ahead of time
  - Creating a schedule and sticking to it is something Cal Newport does.
  Cal Newport blocks off all deep work for the next month.
- Create a shutdown routine for ending the day. The goal of the shutdown routine is to reduce friction for the next day.
  - make tomorrow's todo list today
  - leave stuff half finished
  - use a magic phrase to end the day
- Create a startup routine for starting the day. The goal for the startup routine is to engage positively and clear your mind to start the day.
  - run or go on a walk. This will energize you.
  - get up fast, splash your face with cold water, do not snooze.
  - [[[morning pages]]](../til/morning-pages). Write 750 words (3 pages of hand written text) at the start of the day. You can throw it away afterwards.
  - positivity. Do something positive. Read some comics, Knit. Find enjoyment early.
- Breaks
  - Take meaningful breaks. Go outside, socialize. It will leave you less fatigued then reading the newspaper.
  - Breaks help reduce fatigue at doing a long task.
- Keeping meaningful todo lists
  - Share your to do list publicly
  - The anti todo list. Write what you did not what you plan to do.
