# Conditional Types in Typescript

[Conditional Types in Typescript](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/conditional-types-in-typescript)

Super helpful blog post from Marius Schulz for both understanding typescript conditional types and showing how to decode complex typescript types by hand.

While reading the post I learned about indexed access types and mapped types and honestly felt like I understood some of the typescript internals better than ever before.

Some of the examples would be incredibly helpful in the typescript handbook.
I immediately replicated the type breakdown in my own notes [[[2020-07-28 Scratch]]](../scratch/2020-07-28-scratch).

The step by step type decoding is a fun exercise which I'm definitely interested in trying on my own in the future to improve my typescript abilities.

Definitely want to add more from the typescript evolution series to my [[[reading inbox]]](../inboxes/reading-inbox) [typescript evolution series](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/series/typescript-evolution).
