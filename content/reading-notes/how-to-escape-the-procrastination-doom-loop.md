# How to Escape the Procrastination Doom Loop

## Summary

- Procrastination is an emotional problem.
- True procrastination is when you don't feel like doing something now
  - you will never be in a better mood later
- the anxiety doom loop comes from procrastinating, realizing you procrastinated, feeling anxious and doomed, and procrastinating again because your mood has gotten worse
- to avoid procrastination
  - set external deadlines
  - make your deadlines short and reoccurring
  - break work down into small bite size chunks
  - do anything for 5 minutes. getting started is the hardest part

The more I read about procrastination the more I see patterns in what I'm reading.
The good thing is I can try to apply those patterns to my own behavior.

## Notes

> When we’re truly procrastinating, we delay action because we feel like we’re in the wrong mood to complete a task. And, we assume our mood will change in the near future

How to overcome the procrastination doom loop?

1. Have someone else set deadlines for you.

Have short reoccurring deadlines.

2. Set reminders for after you're supposed to start a project

procrastinators struggle with early reminders because they are reminders of procrastination.
reminders create a bad mood rather than prompting work to get done.

3, start with anything for any amount of time

break tasks into small actionable chunks

do anything for five minutes

start before you're ready
