# Overcoming Procrastination: The Ultimate Guide to finishing what you do

I like the takeaways from this brief post about procrastination from the Rescue Time team.

- Focus on action over emotions
- Bargain with your inner self
- Forgive yourself when you slip

At a high level they say procrastination is an emotional problem.
It is your brain actively avoiding anxiety, pain, depression, or boredom of work and seeking instant gratification.
In the long term procrastination prevents people from accomplishing meaningful work.
Even worse procrastination leads to stress and anxiety which makes it hard to do work and causes the cycle to continue. One of the major instigators for procrastination is a human tendency for *temporal myopia*. A tendency to assume that we'll be in a better mood later on.

To overcome procrastination you need to forgive yourself.
Getting caught up on the past or being angry at yourself does not help get things done.

Next you break things into small chunks.
Give yourself hits of dopamine every time something gets done.
Keep an [Anti Todo List](http://blog.idonethis.com/marc-andreessen-productivity-trick/) of all the things you've gotten done.
To get started on a task which you are procrastinating commit to doing it for 5 minutes.

After reading this I'm just more confident in the rescue time work.
Future reading.
