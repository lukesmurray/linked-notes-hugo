# apply pacing to your work to get more done

There is a macro tendency in any diligent practice for work to have periods of high and low intensity.
In running training plans always start small and increase in intensity over several weeks or even months.
In game development periods of high intensity just before a release are called [crunch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#%22Crunch_time%22).

I think these macro trends can happen within a normal work day as well.
I'll have periods of the day with low intensity work, and periods of the day with high intensity work.
The difference between highly productive days and semi productive or unproductive days is how much high intensity work I can get in.
Every day my goal is to get as much high intensity work in as possible but I often feel burnt out from the previous day, or exhausted by the afternoon.

One strategy that I think could help avoid burn out is slowly incrementing the intensity throughout the day.
Start the days with a [[[morning routine]]](morning-routine) which is low to moderate intensity.
Build up to 25 minute tasks with 5 minutes breaks.
Keep your goals small so that you can have a feeling of accomplishment as often as possible.
After a while you can let your goals start to stretch out a little.
Drop 45 minutes of deep focus in, but keep this time scheduled and stick to it.

Towards the end of the day you'll be feeling the burn of a long day of focused knowledge work.
You'll want to take a break but these are the final miles which make the difference.
Keep on pushing but allow yourself to decrease the intensity.
Return to 25 minutes intervals and 5 minute breaks.

Finally give yourself a cooldown at the end of the day.
Spend 20 minutes writing about what you did, how you felt, and what you plan to do tomorrow.
Do this every day and you'll be working marathons
