# design your code around data

Computer science is the art of data processing.
All computer programs fundamentally deal with managing data, and manipulating data so that it is consumable by humans.
High quality data abstractions are the foundation on top of which you can create high quality tools, git being an amazing example.

From a thread on hacker news [@LinusTorvaldsGit].

> I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships
