# Look for decisions you wouldn’t have made

When you find designs you really like ask yourself if the designer did stuff you would not have thought to do.

This simple question can help you parse out the details which make the design stand out.
Often times it is the small details which separate a bland design you would pass over from a unique design which makes you stop and appreciate it for a moment.
