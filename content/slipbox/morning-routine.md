# morning routine

I'm trying to take advantage of the power of habits and streaks to prevent procrastination, feel more productive, and reduce my anxiety about work.
In the morning I usually feel fresh and some of the anxiety of the previous day has faded away.
By maintaining good habits in the morning I can at least feel like my day is going well by the time afternoon fatigue has set in.

My current morning routine is.

- wake up fast (place water on face get out of bed)
- do some physical exercise
  - currently 15 pushups, 15 situps, 1 minute of planks, and 5 minutes of stretching
- study 5 Anki cards
- drink half of a coffee
- do some affirmations
- write [[[morning pages]]](../til/morning-pages), go on a brisk walk, or try to consume some positive content.
- write down everything I did on my [[[anti todo list]]](../inboxes/anti-todo-list)

I'm pretty good at getting the exercise in. I do affirmations about half the time, and I usually struggle to get in the morning pages.

Overall I don't think that the routine solves everything.
I still have mornings where I wake up feeing groggy, or I want to procrastinate.
But the routine gives me a solid baseline feeling of getting things done which I can try to carry into my work.
