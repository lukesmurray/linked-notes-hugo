# Rebuild your favorite interfaces

When you find an interface you truly love try to recreate it without inspecting the implementation.

In the process of trying to make your version match the original version you'll discover different tricks which may not have been obvious to the original implementers.

Sometimes your tricks will be better than the original, other times you can go back and look at how it was done originally.

This advice comes from the leveling up section of Refactoring UI [@RefactoringUIBook].
