# single txt file todo list

Reference
: [@MyProductivityApp]

In January 2020, Jeff Huang wrote a blog post that he uses a productivity file based on a single txt file.
Jeff uses a single text file as his todo list, calendar, and schedule.
The post took off because the system is incredibly simple but Jeff seems to use it to be very productive.
In general I think people are attracted to systems with simple usage that have large positive effects.
This may be one area where the [Technology Acceptance Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_acceptance_model) is useful.

The post was a throwback to the [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) days.
Todo.txt was popular in the 2010s, and a lot of people built apps based around managing plain text.
Jeff Huang's approach is interesting because while the Todo.txt movement died off Jeff Huang's simple approach continues to work today.

The single file todo list is what got me started with documenting my life in plain text.
As of the day I'm writing this I main a couple of inboxes rather than a single todo list.

- I have a [[[task inbox]]](../inboxes/task-inbox) for tasks which I do not want to forget about.
- I have an [[[anti todo list]]](../inboxes/anti-todo-list) for tasks which I've already done.
- I have a [[[reading inbox]]](../inboxes/reading-inbox) for things which I want to read.
- I have an email inbox for everything else. (joke)
