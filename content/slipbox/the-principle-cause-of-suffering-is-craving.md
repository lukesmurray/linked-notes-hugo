# the principle cause of suffering is craving

I found this interesting parallel between forgiveness, procrastination, and buddhism.
In the Rescue Time Blog they note that

> Procrastinators who feel bad about their habits are more likely to procrastinate in the future
> @OvercomingProcrastinationUltimate2019

In order to stop procrastinating you must forgive yourself and accept that you have procrastinated in the past.
Replace craving with acceptance and work will be easier to accomplish.

> “According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness.
> Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction.
> Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied.
> Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify.
> People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them.
> This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices.
> In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body, witness the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and realise how pointless it is to pursue them.
> When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied.
> All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing – joy, anger, boredom, lust – but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can just accept them for what they are.
> You live in the present moment instead of fantasizing about what might have been.
> The resulting serenity is so profound that those who spend their lives in the frenzied pursuit of pleasant feelings can hardly imagine it.
> It is like a man standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain ‘good’ waves and trying to prevent them from disintegrating, while simultaneously pushing back ‘bad’ waves to prevent them from getting near him.
> Day in, day out, the man stands on the beach, driving himself crazy with this fruitless exercise.
> Eventually, he sits down on the sand and just allows the waves to come and go as they please.
> How peaceful!”
