# use metacognitive strategies to read things once

As I have adopted a space repetition practice in my daily life I'm increasingly surprised by the amount of information I would have forgotten without placing it in my spaced repetition system.
Likewise I am surprised by how much more efficient I am becoming in my daily work by adding facts which I find myself repeatedly looking up to my spaced repetition system.

An example of this is CSS properties.
Although I hate to admit it, for years I have looked up basic CSS property syntax whenever I am designing a website.
I know loosely what I want but I forget all the little details.
"What is the difference between `padding: 1em`, `padding 1em 2em`, `padding 1em 2em 3em` and `padding 1em 2em 3em 4em`?"

I answered this question forever by adding a card to my spaced repetition system which explains that box model dimensions are specified in clockwise order from the top `top right bottom left`.
If any of the four values is missing the value is mirrored from the opposing side.
If only one value is specified all sides receive the same value.

I now have a stronger mental model for CSS padding, and because CSS is well designed I can apply this model to other properties such as margin and border.

Sure it is easy enough to look up the syntax in the documentation but how much benefit do I get from secondary, tertiary, or further readings of the CSS padding documentation.
How much time do I spend trying to scan the documentation, seeking the answer I've looked up 4-5 times before?
Am I getting better at working with CSS and applying UX guidelines to my projects or am I getting better at searching documentation?
I don't have measurements to prove it but I believe there is an exponentially decreasing return in the value of rereads of previous documents and papers.

In [[[Timeful Texts]]](../reading-notes/timeful-texts) Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen argue that for a book or text to become an indelible experience the reader must assimilate the ideas and mental models into their lives over an extended period of time [@matuschakTimefulTexts2020].
They recognize that most books do not become indelible experiences because the process of becoming an indelible experience is brittle and rife with pitfalls.
The solution they give is not to read and reread the text over and over again.
Instead they build a text where pieces of the text are extracted into prompts and questions which can be adopted into an evolving spaced repetition system over time. [^quantum]

The question is how can I augment my initial readings of text with better metacognitive strategies?
Michael Nielsen gives some tips in his essay Augmenting Longterm Memory [@nielsenAugmentingLongtermMemory2018].

- Add visual prompts to your spaced repetition in order to internalize core claims.
Describe or recreate figures and graphs.
- Add 3-5 prompts per paper or essay so that the paper has enough context in your spaced repetition system
- Make your prompts atomic. Atomic ideas are easier to connect to other ideas, and easier to recall.

In addition to the spaced repetition work I have a couple of strategies I like to adopt on my own.

- Make the paper your own mess.
Cross out sections you don't enjoy.
Highlight sections your enjoy.
By the time you're done the paper will be unrecognizable but the augmentations provide spatial and visual recall prompts for any return reading.
- Write a summary of the paper if you find it particularly interesting, but write the summary in your own words.
The process of writing about the paper helps lay a foundation for ideas in your own mind.
Rather than return to reread the paper, return to the summary.
If you have questions or unsure of something, try to find an answer in the paper but elaborate on the answer in your summary.

Hopefully by adopting these practices in my reading I can start to read papers and essays once but remember them forever.
