## Basic Process for Deep Reads

- skim the paper
  - identify important techniques and ideas
  - find basic facts and terminology
  - add elementary questions to anki
  - Michael Nielsen gives alpha go as an example
  - > “What's the size of a Go board?”; “Who plays first in Go?”; “How many human game positions did AlphaGo learn from?”; “Where did AlphaGo get its training data?”; “What were the names of the two main types of neural network AlphaGo used?”
- do a couple passes of the paper in this skimming mode adding questions as you go along but ignoring high level areas of confusion or the desire to dive into the details
- do a thorough pass of the paper
- do a second thorough pass of the paper
  - in the thorough pass add high level questions
- continue to add questions as you write about what you've read

## Why use this method?

Because it creates a compounding effect over time.
The knowledge you gain originally reading the paper is not lost.
Future papers will be much easier to read.

## Basic Process for Shallow Reads

- only do the skim process
- skim the paper a couple of times, spending between 10 and 60 minutes
- add between 5-20 prompts to anki
- if you have fewer than 5 prompts delete all of them the paper is not worth remembering
