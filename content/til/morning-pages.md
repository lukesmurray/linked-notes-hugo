# morning pages

Morning pages are a simple practice.
Write 750 words of hand written text at the start of the day then throw it away.
The 750 words give you a chance to clear your mind, become more aware of your thought patterns, and simultaneously get the creativity juices flowing.
I added morning pages to my [[[morning routine]]](../slipbox/morning-routine) after reading about them in [[[a short guide to managing your time and fitting more into every day]]](../reading-notes/a-short-guide-to-managing-your-time-and-fitting-more-into-every-day).

> Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning.
> *There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages*– they are not high art.
> They are not even “writing.” They are about anything and everything that crosses your mind– and they are for your eyes only.
> Morning Pages provoke, clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and synchronize the day at hand.
> Do not over-think Morning Pages: just put three pages of anything on the page...and then do three more pages tomorrow.
