# Shape Outside

Today I learned about the `shape-outside` property in CSS while reading Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's most recent essay Timeful Texts [@matuschakTimefulTexts2020] with illustrations by Maggie Appleton.

The text is interspersed with beautiful illustrations by Maggie Appleton of papers falling down the page.

Normally when I see a nice design I think to myself "oh thats nice" and move on. But I want to follow the advice from Refactoring UI [@RefactoringUIBook] and

- [[[Look for decisions you wouldnâ€™t have made]]](../slipbox/look-for-decisions-you-wouldnt-have-made)
- [[[Rebuild your favorite interfaces]]](../slipbox/rebuild-your-favorite-interfaces)

I checked the image to see if it was not a rectangle, but the image is clearly a rectangle, even if parts of it are transparent.

Next I looked at the paragraph to see if whitespace was used to somehow avoid the image.
The paragraph seemed to have no special styles associated with it.
Finally I found a mysterious `shape-outside` property on the image.
Since I had never seen the `shape-outside` property I was fairly sure this was what I was looking for.

```css
.leftFloat {
		float: left;
		position: relative;
		left: -170px;
		top: 0px;
		shape-outside: polygon(0 50px, 80px 50px, 0px 140px);
    background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 10%);
}
```

```html
<p>
Esse do minim Lorem sit cillum deserunt consectetur officia dolor sint enim quis. Velit minim aliquip quis culpa adipisicing. Laboris veniam deserunt pariatur consequat est labore qui ut ea deserunt.
<img src="/assets/page-falling-down-the-screen.png" class="leftFloat"/>
</p>
```

The `shape-outside` combined with `float` is the trick.
`float` by itself places an element on the left or right side of its container allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.
Normally content wraps around a floated element's margin box.
With `shape-outside` this wrapping can be customized.

In Timeful Texts Maggie wraps the text using a simple `polygon` forming a triangle.
The `polygon` is placed on the left side of the image.
But the image is then translated left as well so the polygon appears on the right.

Here is the effect reproduced with a background image so the bounds of the image are more obvious.

## Example

<style>
.leftFloat {
		float: left;
		position: relative;
		left: -170px;
		top: 0px;
		shape-outside: polygon(0 50px, 80px 50px, 0px 140px);
    border: none;
    background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 10%);
}
</style>

<div>
  <p>
  <img src="/assets/page-falling-down-the-screen.png" class="leftFloat"/>
  Esse do minim Lorem sit cillum deserunt consectetur officia dolor sint enim quis. Velit minim aliquip quis culpa adipisicing. Laboris veniam deserunt pariatur consequat est labore qui ut ea deserunt.
